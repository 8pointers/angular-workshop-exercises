## Exercise 2

Implement a app-shopping-cart component that renders the content of the shopping basket:

```javascript
this.items = [
  { name: 'Angular 2 Book', price: 10 },
  { name: 'Fridge', price: 250 },
  { name: 'Socks', price: 20 },
  { name: 'AA Batteries', price: 5 }
];
```

Make sure that the items are sorted by price.
Also, compute and display the total price.
Premium items (price > 100) should be rendered as red.
