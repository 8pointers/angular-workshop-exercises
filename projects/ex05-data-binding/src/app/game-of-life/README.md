## Exercise 2

Implement Game of Life component, so that size of the grid (n) and cell dimensions (width and height) can be configured. Clicking on the next button should compute and display the next state of the game, according to the [rules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life#Rules) of the game.

```javascript
<app-game-of-life [n]="10" [width]="20" [height]="20"></app-game-of-life>
```
